my name is avery sommer, i am an undergraduate student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with a lot of free time, and this is the product of that. this site will contain photographs that i take and any coding projects that i want to share. i mainly plan to do large scale data analysis projects with clear and concise directions on how to replicate them. 

i photograph (and sometimes write) for <i>The Polytechnic</i> and you can find my staff page <a class="poly" href="https://poly.rpi.edu/staff/avery-sommer/">here</a>. we currently do not have proper attribution for photographers so here are some articles that illustrate my photographic ability: <a class="poly" href="https://poly.rpi.edu/features/2019/12/pss-troy-transported-back-in-time/">PSS: Troy transported back in time</a>, <a class="poly" href="https://poly.rpi.edu/features/2019/10/rpi-aims-to-become-stronger-than-the-stigma/">RPI aims to become 'Stronger Than the Stigma'</a>, <a class="poly" href="https://poly.rpi.edu/sports/2019/04/teamrpi-overwatch-wins-local-championship/">TeamRPI Overwatch wins local championship</a>, and <a class="poly" href="https://poly.rpi.edu/features/2019/02/an-evening-of-performance-excites-delights-on-valentines-day/">An Evening of Performance excites, delights on Valentineâ€™s Day</a>. you can also view them in my <a href="/photos/photojournalism">gallery</a>.

<li>mechanical keyboards, currently i am using a <a href="https://www.drevo.net/product/keyboard/excalibur-cherry-mx">drevo excalibur</a> with mx cherry blues with double 1.5mm o-rings and have plans to design my own keyboard.</li>
<li>puzzle games, some of my favourites include
<ul>
<li><a href="http://the-witness.net/">the witness</a> a beautiful isolated adventure.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.croteam.com/talosprinciple/">the talos principle</a> a psychological contradictory journey.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/620/Portal_2/">portal 2</a> a classic entertaining experience.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

i was inspired to make this site from a blog post by one of my good friends. he wrote a post outlining a program he made that seamlessly loops through the different segments of an audio track, which allows for extended play time. you can read it <a href="https://brianmejia.github.io/2018/07/16/musical-phases-in-python.html">here</a>.
